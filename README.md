The goal of this project is to build a **scalable e-commerce platform** that includes a frontend, backend, and real-time analytics dashboard. The platform will allow users to browse products, make purchases, and track their orders, while providing administrators with insights into sales, user behavior, and inventory management.

This project will leverage **full-stack development**, **cloud-based infrastructure**, and **modern technologies** like TypeScript, GraphQL, and AWS. It will also incorporate multiple data stores and databases to ensure scalability and performance.
